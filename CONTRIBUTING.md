## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker (for testing the add-on)
- Git
- A Bluetooth-enabled device for testing

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/burhanyldz/bluetooth-actions.git
   cd bluetooth-actions
   ```

2. Set up Python environment:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the backend locally:
   ```bash
   python app.py --port 8099 --log-level debug
   ```

4. Open the frontend in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8099
   ```

### Testing with Docker

Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t bluetooth-manager .

docker run -it --rm \
  --privileged \
  --network host \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  bluetooth-manager
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

Example:
```python
def connect_device(self, mac_address: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Connect to a Bluetooth device
    
    Args:
        mac_address: MAC address of the device
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (success, message)
    """
    # Implementation
```

### JavaScript

- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Write clear, descriptive function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused

Example:
```javascript
async connectDevice(mac) {
    try {
        this.showLoading('Connecting...');
        await this.api.connectDevice(mac);
        this.showToast('Connected successfully', 'success');
    } catch (error) {
        this.showToast(`Failed: ${error.message}`, 'error');
    } finally {
        this.hideLoading();
    }
}
```

### CSS

- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for colors
- Follow BEM naming convention where appropriate
- Keep selectors specific but not overly nested
- Group related styles together
- Add comments for complex layouts

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Test all functionality** - Ensure existing features still work
2. **Test your changes** - Verify your new feature/fix works as expected
3. **Test on different devices** - Check responsive design on mobile/tablet
4. **Check console** - No JavaScript errors
5. **Check logs** - No Python exceptions
6. **Test error cases** - How does it handle failures?

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Adapter power on/off works
- [ ] Scanning discovers devices
- [ ] Pairing works correctly
- [ ] Connecting/disconnecting works
- [ ] Device information displays correctly
- [ ] Trust/untrust functions work
- [ ] Remove device works
- [ ] UI is responsive on mobile
- [ ] Toast notifications appear correctly
- [ ] Loading states show appropriately
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No Python exceptions in logs

## Documentation

When adding new features:

1. Update the **README.md** if needed
2. Add docstrings to Python functions
3. Comment complex JavaScript code
4. Update **CHANGELOG.md**
5. Update API documentation if adding endpoints
